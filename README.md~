Move Pusheen!
in this simple Javascript game, every time the 'move' button is pushed,
Pusheen the cat moves around the room.

this set up employs 2 functions one that moves the pusheen image arround a grid.
One that removes the image from its previous place in the grid when the button is pushed again.
arguably these 2 could be done in on function so i have added a third to post a comment to the top of the page.
